# Touch Designer For Multi Sensory Story Telling 

This is meant to be the repository for a 3 hour Touch Designer Session Titled "Touch Designer For Multi Sensory Story Telling".  This title is meant to reflect the idea that Touch Designer is an effective platform and medium for artists, creative developers and story tellers to get a message accross to their audience.  

### Motivations 
As artists and technologists we have a few main reasons to be excited and interested in the Touch Designer Platform.

Experimentation 
Accessibility 
Peformance 
Expressivity 
Community 


### High Level Goals 
1. Provide a hollistic and genuine argument for using TouchDesigner as a multimedia platform
2. Understand the basics of using the software 
3. Get to a level of competence to be able to execute on ideas


 ### Deliverable Goals 
 1. Build a mock installation that involves the following techniques and technology
 2. Playing & Managing Media (Movies,Videos, Audio, Live Webcam )
 3. Processing Human Interaction 
    a. Register Input From a Arduino
    b. Register Input From People in a webcam 
 4. Adding Expressiveness to existing media 
    a. Feedback Loops and Color Transformation of Videos 
    b. Sound Collage and Mixing 
    c. Transitions of Videos from 
 5. Triggering things in the real world(Via Arduino)  
 6. Interface with an external audio system like Ableton 
 7. Produce a basic 3D Animation
